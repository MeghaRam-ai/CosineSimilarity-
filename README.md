# CosineSimilarity-
## Instructions
It is required from you to write a Python code that:

- asks the user to enter 2 sentences
- can compare how much the 2 sentences are similar
- should use the cosine similarity to compare the sentences
- should accept numerical values
- should not take special characters into account ("Hi" or "hi" should be considered as the same sentence)
- should deal exactly the same way with upper or lower case characters ("I am happy" and "I am happy..." should be considered as the same sentence)
